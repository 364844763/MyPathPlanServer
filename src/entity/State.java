/**
 * A Node interface is used to represent the states within the SearchDomain in a uniform
 * way. Though those states could ultimately be represented, explicitly or implicitly, in
 * any form within the domain application, the application should provide those states
 * via the Node interface. As all of the search algorithms at some point need to compare
 * Nodes, the requirement for a Node is that it should be comparable, which an application
 * can provide by implementing the equals(·) method.
